DeepRed is a dark Slim theme. Main colors are red and black.
I've developed it in order to have a good login theme for DarkBlood
fluxbox theme by cHoBi.
I use 1280x800 so it works better at that resolution. If you have
problems with other resolution fix it by editing input position in
slim.theme or write me to have it fixed :P


Install
________________________________________________________________________

- Untar the theme in /usr/share/slim/themes/
- Edit /etc/slim.conf like these examples:
      current_theme       deepred
  or, if you want to use a random theme use comma-separated theme names
      current_theme       deepred,flat,default

I hope you like it!
